# Glo Webhooks Examples

## Running Locally
Prerequisites:
- Node v6 or greater
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

1. Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm i`
2. Edit the value of `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `server.js` to be a string of your choosing.
3. Run the server with `node .`
4. Create an ngrok url pointing to the webhook server by running `ngrok http 8080`
5. [Create a webhook in Glo](https://support.gitkraken.com/developers/webhooks/set-up/), using the ngrok forwarding URL generated by the previous step as the payload URL, and using the same secret you used for the value of `WEBHOOK_SECRET` (or leave blank if it's empty string)

Now when you perform an action in Glo, you should see the server log the webhook payload.
